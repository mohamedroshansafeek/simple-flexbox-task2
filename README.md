I recreated my Flexbox task using only HTML and CSS to build a responsive and clean layout. The main objective of this project was to practice CSS Flexbox properties like `display: flex`, `justify-content`, `align-items`, and `flex-wrap`. The layout adjusts smoothly across different screen sizes and maintains proper alignment and spacing. This project helped me strengthen my understanding of modern layout techniques using only HTML and CSS without any frameworks.
